<h2>Instructions</h2> 
<p><b>Step 1:</b> Make coffee with an espresso machine and set aside to cool. </p>
<p><b>Step 2:</b> Separate the egg whites from yolks. Whip the egg whites at a high speed until stiff peaks form. Set aside. </p>
<p><b>Step 3:</b> Combine the egg yolks with sugar and whip until smooth. </p>
<p><b>Step 4:</b> Add the marscapone into the sugar and egg yolks. Slowly whip until fully combined. Now add the stiff egg whites and fold in with a wooden spoon. </p>
<p><b>Step 5:</b> Dip ladyfingers into coffee for 1-2 seconds. <i>Note: Be careful not to soak for too long, or else they will become soggy.</i> Place ladyfingers on the bottom of a container of your liking.</p>
<p><b>Step 6:</b> Once you have covered the bottom, add a layer of the whipped cream mixture. Continue this process with the rest of the ladyfingers. </p>
<p><b>Step 7:</b> Once you have finished, generously sprinkle the top with cocoa powder. </p>
<p><b>NOTE: Refrigerate for at least 3 hours before serving. If possible, letting it rest overnight is optimal.</b> </p>
